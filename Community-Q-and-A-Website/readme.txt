Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install React, Express.js, and PostgreSQL for your application.

1. Installing React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Follow these steps to install React:

Open your terminal.
Navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to install React:
==============================
npx create-react-app my-app
==============================
This command will create a new React application in a directory named "my-app."
Then change the public and src files to downloaded files.

2. Installing Express.js
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. To install Express.js, follow these steps:

Open your terminal.
Navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to install Express.js:
=====================
npm install express
=====================

Express.js will now be installed and ready for use in your project.

3. Installing PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. To install PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

Visit the official PostgreSQL website (https://www.postgresql.org) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation process.
Once installed, make sure PostgreSQL is running and accessible on your system.
Setting up React App with Express.js Backend

After installing React and Express.js, you can now set up your React app with an Express.js backend. Follow these steps:

In your project directory, navigate to the React app's server folder  if not present create one. using the terminal:
Enter app.js, or whatever you want the name of the main file to be. If you want it to be index.js, hit RETURN to accept the suggested default file name.

Now install Express in the server directory and save it in the dependencies list. For example:
===================
npm install express
===================

Create a new file named "server.js" in the root folder.

Open "index.js" in a text editor and add the following code for demo:
===================================================
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3001; // or any preferred port number

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express.js!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
====================================================
Save the file.
In the terminal, run the following command to start the Express.js server:
================
node index.js
================
in our case its index.js the instructions are created by npm install express as package.json
You should see the message "Server running on port 3001" if the server starts successfully.

Now, your React app and Express.js backend are set up. You can continue developing your application with the desired functionality.
